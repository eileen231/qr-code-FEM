## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Flexboxes are quite handy. Also practicing on the Flexbox Froggy site was helpful as well.

### Continued development

Adding a background image instead of the white screen.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Practice](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
